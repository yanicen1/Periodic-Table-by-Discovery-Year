## 🌍🔬 History of the Periodic Table 🔬🌍

This features an animated periodic table that visualizes the discovery timeline of all chemical elements.

From ancient elements like Gold (Au) and Copper (Cu), known for thousands of years, to the most recently synthesized Oganesson (Og) — this interactive visualization shows how our knowledge of the elements has progressed through history.

It’s a fusion of data visualization, materials science, and storytelling — designed to engage both scientists and the general public.
